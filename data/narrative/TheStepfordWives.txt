The premise involves the married men of the fictional town of Stepford, Connecticut and their fawning, submissive, impossibly beautiful wives.
The protagonist is Joanna Eberhart, a talented photographer newly arrived from New York City with her husband and children, eager to start a new life.
As time goes on, she becomes increasingly disturbed by the zombie-like, submissive wives of Stepford, especially when she sees her once independent-minded friends, fellow new arrivals to Stepford, turn into mindless, docile housewives overnight.
Her husband, who seems to be spending more and more time at meetings of the local men's association, mocks her fears.
As the story progresses, Joanna becomes convinced that the wives of Stepford are being poisoned or brainwashed into submission by the men's club.
She visits the library and researches the pasts of Stepford's wives, discovering that some of the women were once feminist activists and very successful professionals and that the leader of the men's club is a former Disney engineer and others are artists and scientists, capable of creating lifelike robots.
Her friend Bobbie helps her investigate, going so far as to write to the EPA to inquire about possible environmental toxins in Stepford.
However, eventually, Bobbie is also transformed into a docile housewife and has no interest in her previous activities.
At the end of the novel, Joanna decides to flee Stepford but when she gets home she finds that her children have been taken.
She asks her husband to let her leave but he takes her car keys.
She manages to escape from the house on foot and several of the men's club members track her down.
They corner her in the woods, and she accuses them of creating robots out of the town's women.
The men deny the accusation and ask Joanna if she would believe them if she saw one of the other women bleed.
Joanna agrees to this, and they take her to Bobbie's house.
Bobbie's husband and son are upstairs, with loud rock music playing as if to cover screams.
The scene ends as Bobbie brandishes a knife at her former friend.
In the story's epilogue, Joanna has become another Stepford wife gliding through the local supermarket and has given up her career as a photographer while Ruthanne (a new resident in Stepford) appears poised to become the conspiracy's next victim.
