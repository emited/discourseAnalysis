Harry unintentionally impresses the producers with an outburst of remorse they mistake for method acting.
At a Hollywood party before a screen test, Harry meets private investigator Perry van Shrike, hired to give Harry on-the-job experience for his role, and party host Harlan Dexter, a retired actor who recently resolved a ten year feud over his wife's inheritance with his daughter, Veronica.
He also encounters his childhood crush Harmony Lane, but wakes up in bed with her hostile friend.
He runs over to Harmony's place at 6am to apologize.
Perry and Harry witness a vehicle being dumped in a lake and are spotted by the apparent killers.
Perry shoots the trunk lock in a rescue attempt, but accidentally hits the female corpse inside as well.
They cannot report the body because it appears Perry killed her.
Harmony contacts Harry, explaining that her sister Jenna came to L.A., stole Harmony's credit cards, and later killed herself.

After she leaves, Harry discovers the lake corpse in his bathroom and a planted pistol.
Harry and Perry dump the corpse, later identified as Veronica Dexter by police.
Harry discovers it was Harmony's credit card that was used to hire Perry to come to the lake, tying Jenna to their case.
He goes to see Harmony, who (accidentally) slams the door on his finger, cutting it off, and she takes him to the hospital.
They go to a party but Harry is abducted, beaten and threatened to cease the investigation by the killers from the lake, and then let go.
While taking Harry back to the hospital, Harmony sees the killers heading to Perry's stakeout.
Realizing that Perry is heading into a trap, she leaves Harry in her car and rushes off to the stakeout, where she saves Perry and one of the killers gets shot to death by a food-cart operator.

Harmony steals the van containing the coffin.
Harry and Perry escape, but Harmony crashes the van.
Perry is incapacitated in the ensuing shootout; Harry manages to kill Dexter and his thugs, but is also shot.
Waking in a hospital, Harry finds that Perry and Harmony are fine.
Perry reveals Harmony's sister was not murdered but committed suicide.
Jenna had escaped incest in Indiana and located Dexter, believing him to be her real father.
She accidentally witnessed Dexter having sex with Veronica's impostor, the pink-haired girl.
Believing this father was also incestuous, Jenna commissioned Perry and committed suicide.
Perry travels back to Harmony's home town and confronts Jenna's father who is now bed-ridden, slapping him multiple times and calling him an animal.
When the old man berates Perry for attacking a helpless old man, Perry says simply, "Yeah.
Big tough guy," and leaves without further explanation.
