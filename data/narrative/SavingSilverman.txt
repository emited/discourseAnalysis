Darren Silverman, Wayne LeFessier, and J.D. McNugent, best friends since fifth grade and Neil Diamond fans throughout, form a Neil Diamond tribute band called "Diamonds in the Rough". Darren meets a beautiful but domineering psychologist who is showing signs of being emotionally abusive , Judith Fessbeggler, through a chance encounter in a local bar after a band gig.
Unfortunately, six weeks into their relationship, Judith is still making Darren watch her change clothes, and though sleeping together is satisfying for her, Darren gets nothing but a sore jaw.
Judith isolates Darren from his friends, demands that Darren quit the band, receive humiliating medical procedures, and attend relationship counseling under her care.
Wayne and J.D. decide to save Darren from her by attempting to bribe her, arm wrestle her, and shock her with faked photographs of Darren cheating, all to no avail.
The friends, undaunted, try to reunite Darren with his "one and only", Sandy Perkus, when she returns to Seattle to take her final vows as a nun.
When Darren and Judith announce their engagement, Wayne and J.D. kidnap Judith.
However, Judith eventually discovers the identity of her captors, and the duo are convinced they cannot let her go.
When they visit Coach Norton in jail (who accidentally killed a referee in a fit of rage) his advice is that they should just kill her.
The duo attempt to shoot Judith, but end up deciding against it.
Sandy's feelings for Darren are reawakened, but the pair's attempted date is ruined by Darren's preoccupation with Judith.
Sandy, disheartened, returns to the convent, but Darren snaps out of it and runs the 30 miles there to win her back.
Chained to an engine block in Wayne's garage, Judith convinces J.D. he is gay.
She knocks him unconscious to steal his keys and escape, only to be tranquilized with a dart gun by Wayne.
Returned to the garage, Judith seduces Wayne into releasing one of her hands, so she escapes again.
She runs to Darren's house in time to see him kiss Sandy, but shames him into confessing his engagement to Judith.
Sandy, disheartened, returns to the convent again.
Darren has Wayne and J.D. arrested.
After escaping from jail with the help of Coach Norton, J.D. and Wayne rush to the convent on the brink of Sandy's final vows as a nun.
They convince her that Darren still loves her.
They then kidnap Neil Diamond to help Darren and Sandy reunite.
At the wedding, Neil stalls the proceedings with song while Darren and Sandy reunite, Wayne and Judith beat each other up (as love play) and J.D. arrives holding Coach in his arms, who coincidentally reveals to J.D. that he is gay as well.
The couples then wed on stage at Neil Diamond's concert; Darren to Sandy, Wayne to Judith, and J.D. to Coach.
As the film closes, the entire cast sings "Holly Holy".
