When a dorm toilet explodes on the first day back to school, a group of misfit girlfriends are forced to leave their housing and search for a new home.
They ultimately decide on pledging a sorority.
However, not many sororities are normal at South Beach University.
The girls decide to pledge the most popular and exclusive sorority at the university, Gamma Gamma, which is led by president Victoria English.
While pledging the sorority, Victoria sends the girls to do a task: collect used condoms.
While searching the park, the leader of the group, Gloria, bumps into Victoria's boyfriend Derek, and they become close.
The only reason Victoria plans to let the freshmen pledge is to display diversity, which is a requirement for the "FHM Hottest Sorority in the Country" contest.
From then on, Victoria declares war on the girls during "Hell Week" but ultimately lets them join, only to kick them out once they have won the contest.
This angers the leader of the misfit freshmen, Gloria.
Gloria decides to quit the sorority as do her friends.
Derek and Gloria realize their feelings towards each other and seal it with a kiss.
Gloria's ex-best friend, Kristen, convinces Gloria to come back.
Gloria and her friends come back but only to declare war on Victoria by sneaking into the Gamma Gamma house and stealing embarrassing photos and video footage of her to show to everyone at the Gamma Gamma victory party.
The video also showed her badmouthing her sorority sisters, and her past dorky self.
She also reveals to Victoria that she and Derek love each other.
Victoria becomes embarrassed and eventually realizes how reinventing herself made her into a bad person, so she makes a public apology to the freshmen.
The movie ends with a giant food fight at the Gamma Gamma party, and Victoria saying that she loved her cover of FHM so much she bought the magazine.
Gloria becomes the president of Gamma Gamma the following year.
