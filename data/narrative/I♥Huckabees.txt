Albert Markovski (Jason Schwartzman) is a young man who heads the local chapter of an environmental group, the "Open Spaces Coalition". One of their current projects is an attempt to stop the building of a new Huckabees store, a chain of "big-box" department stores.
Albert is a rival of Brad Stand (Jude Law), a shallow power executive at Huckabees.
Brad infiltrates Open Spaces and charismatically displaces Albert as the leader.
Dawn Campbell (Naomi Watts) is Brad's live-in girlfriend and the face and voice of Huckabees; she appears in all of the store's commercials.
After seeing the same conspicuous stranger three times, Albert contacts two existential detectives, Bernard (Dustin Hoffman) and Vivian Jaffe (Lily Tomlin). The detectives offer Albert their optimistic brand of existentialismthey name it universal interconnectivity (which has some tenets of romantic and transcendentalist philosophies)and spy on him, ostensibly to help him solve the coincidence.
Bernard and Vivian introduce Albert to Tommy Corn (Mark Wahlberg), an obsessively anti-petroleum firefighter.
Tommy is assigned to Albert as his Other.
Tommy grows dissatisfied with the Jaffes, feeling that they are not helping him.
Seeking out other possibilities, Tommy ends up abandoning and undermining the Jaffes by introducing Albert to Caterine Vauban (Isabelle Huppert), a former student of the Jaffes who espouses a seemingly opposing nihilistic/absurdist philosophy.
She teaches them to disconnect their inner beings from their daily lives and their problems, to synthesize a non-thinking state of "pure being." Being lifted from their troubles, they wish to keep that feeling forever, yet she tells them that it is inevitable to be drawn back to the human drama, and to understand that the core truth of that drama is misery and meaninglessness.
In order to prove her point, Caterine takes Albert to go and have sex in the woods, leaving Tommy behind.
Tommy finds out about the two of them being together and feels hurt.
Caterine tells him that they found each other through all of the human suffering and drama.
Tommy rejects this idea and leaves them furious and lost.
Meanwhile, in Brad's further attempts to undercut Albert, he and Dawn meet with and are influenced by Bernard and Vivian.
In the following days, Brad and Dawn rethink their entire lives: Dawn rejects the modeling world and looks for deeper meaning, and Brad realizes that his whole ascent in the corporate ladder is meaningless, as he has lived his whole life just trying to please others and not himself.
All the storylines collide when Brad's house catches fire.
While the fire trucks get stuck in a traffic jam, Tommy comes on his bicycle to put out the fire, which incidentally trapped Dawn inside.
As he saves her life, the two fall in love.
Meanwhile, Brad despairs at the destruction of his house, the symbol of his material success.
Albert attains a sort of enlightenment when he synthesizes the two opposing outlooks of the Jaffes and Vauban to realize the cosmic truth of everything.
Brad, meanwhile, is fired from Huckabees, leaving him rudderless.
Albert reveals to Brad that he burned Brad's jet skis, and the fire spread to the house.
Albert understands that he and Brad are no different, that everything really is inextricably connected, but that these connections necessarily arise from the often senselessly painful reality of human existence.
Having realized this, he refers Brad to Caterine, hoping she will help him as she did Albert and Tommy.
Albert and Tommy talk later about everything that has happened.
As the two talk, Caterine and the Jaffes watch them, concluding that they can close both of their cases.
